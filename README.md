# Minimal Bitcoin Widget

A minimal Bitcoin price widget for your home screen ðŸ“ˆ

This Android application allows you to place a sleek and minimal Bitcoin price widget on your home screen! Minimal Bitcoin Widget sources price information from the CoinGecko API.
The widget conforms to your current system device theme - light and dark mode!

New features will be added as I work on them! Thank you for the support!
